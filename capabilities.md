# Capabilities

This section is for individuals, teams, labs, or companies to describe what they can contribute to the BCI and neurotechnology ecosystem.

The goal is not marketing, but **clear signal**: what you can reliably do, at what maturity level, and under what collaboration conditions.

## Why this matters

Effective collaboration depends on asymmetric but complementary capabilities. Making these explicit reduces friction, avoids mismatches, and accelerates co-development.

## Capability Categories (examples)

* Neural interface hardware (electrodes, probes, packaging)
* Chip design (ASIC, FPGA, analog front-end, low-noise design)
* Algorithms (signal processing, decoding, ML, closed-loop control)
* Systems integration (firmware, hardware–software co-design)
* Neuroscience & experimentation (animal models, behavior, imaging)
* Clinical translation & regulatory pathways
* Manufacturing, testing, and scaling
* Tooling, standards, and infrastructure

## Capability Template

Use the following structure when posting your capabilities:

* Individual / Organization:
* Domain:
* Core capability:
* Maturity level:

  * Concept / Prototype / Validated / Production
* Availability:

  * Open collaboration / Limited / Commercial
* Preferred collaboration mode:

  * Open-source / Co-development / Contract / Advisory
* Geographic location (optional):
* Contact method:

## Example

* Organization: Neuroelectronics Design Team
* Domain: Analog & mixed-signal IC design
* Core capability: Low-noise neural front-end ASICs for implantable systems
* Maturity level: Validated silicon
* Availability: Co-development and commercial projects
* Preferred collaboration mode: Joint development with clear IP boundaries
* Location: US / EU
* Contact: GitHub Issues or email

## Trust & credibility

Credibility on this platform is built through:

* documented contributions
* references to public work or collaborations
* reproducible artifacts when possible

Over time, capabilities are expected to form a **reputation graph**, not a static résumé.
