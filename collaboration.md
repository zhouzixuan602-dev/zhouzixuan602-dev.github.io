# Collaboration

This page describes how collaboration is expected to work on this platform.

The focus is on **low-friction discovery**, **clear boundaries**, and **long-term trust**.

## Types of collaboration

Collaborations on this platform may include:

* Open exploratory discussions
* Short-term problem solving or benchmarking
* Medium-term co-development projects
* Long-term strategic partnerships

Not all collaborations need to be open — but clarity is required.

## How to start a collaboration

1. Identify a relevant **Need** or **Capability**
2. Open an Issue or Discussion with:

   * a short introduction
   * scope of interest
   * expected time horizon
3. Agree early on:

   * openness level
   * IP boundaries
   * communication channel

## Openness levels

We encourage contributors to clearly label collaboration intent:

* **Open**: public discussion, open artifacts
* **Hybrid**: public coordination + private execution
* **Closed**: discovery only, NDA required later

There is no default — transparency of intent matters more than the choice itself.

## Collaboration hygiene

Healthy collaborations usually share these traits:

* explicit scope and expectations
* early alignment on terminology and interfaces
* written summaries of decisions
* respect for different incentives (academic, industrial, commercial)

## Failure is allowed

Not all collaborations will succeed. Ending a collaboration cleanly and respectfully is considered a success of process, not a failure of intent.

## Outcome-first mindset

Whenever possible, collaborations should leave behind:

* documentation
* reference designs
* benchmarks
* lessons learned

These outputs help the ecosystem learn, even if a project ends.
