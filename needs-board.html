## 🧠 How to Post a Need (Read This First)

Write your need like an **executable task**, not a vague idea.

Please include:
- **One-line title + concrete outcome**
- **Inputs / Outputs / Acceptance criteria**
- **Time window & response method**
- **What you can offer** (authorship, funding, data, access, compute…)

If it’s easy to understand, it’s easy to match.
